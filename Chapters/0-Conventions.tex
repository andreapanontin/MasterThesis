\section*{Notation and conventions}
We will not worry about universes. More precisely we will
tacitly assume a universe $\mathbb{U}$ has been chosen
and we restrict to categories whose objects lie in $\mathbb{U}$.
We will denote categories using a sans serif font.
In particular we will use the following notations:
$\mathsf{Sch}_{S}$ for the category of schemes over $S$,
$\mathsf{Gp}$ for that of groups,
$\mathsf{Ab}$ for that of abelian groups,
$\mathsf{Top}$ for that of topological spaces,
and $\mathsf{Sets}$ for that of sets.
Moreover, by {\em ring} or {\em algebra}, we will mean one which is commutative and with unity.
Finally we will often denote an object $X \in \mathrm{Ob} \left(\mathsf{C}\right)$ 
of a category $\mathsf{C}$ simply by $X \in \mathsf{C}$.
