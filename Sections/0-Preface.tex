\section*{Introduction}
In his renown paper, \cite{TatePC}, Tate proved a very explicit Hodge-like decomposition
of the Tate module of a Barsotti-Tate group, when tensored with $\mathbb{C}_p$.
In particular, when working over abelian schemes, this granted a decomposition of the
étale cohomology with coefficients in $\mathbb{Q}_p$.
It was this paper which started the development of the field that became $p$-adic Hodge theory,
following the push from Tate to find analogous decompositions for the étale cohomology
with values in $\mathbb{C}_p$ for schemes admitting a proper and smooth model over
the ring of integers of some local field $K$.
This result was achieved by Fontaine employing its so called {\em period rings},
which allowed him to go even further and obtain finer results in the
study of cohomology theory.
In particular, when dealing with a variety $X$ over $K$, admitting
a proper smooth model over $O_K$, tensoring with the period ring $B_{\mathrm{cris}}$
grants an isomorphism between de Rham and crystalline cohomology.
In the case of abelian varieties étale cohomology is just the dual
of the Tate module of its associated Barsotti-Tate group,
whereas crystalline cohomology is represented by the Dieudonné
of the associated Barsotti-Tate group.
The aim of this text is to prove a crystalline comparison theorem which
grants an isomorphism between the objects we just mentioned, after tensoring
with the period ring $B_{\mathrm{cris}}$.
To achieve this goal we will introduce the basic language of group schemes, which
will allow the definition of $p$-divisible groups or Barsotti-Tate groups.
The notion of sheaves on sites will be also discussed in order to give some
extra tools to work with Barsotti-Tate groups and Dieudonné modules.
We will define the concept of divided powers with the aim
of defining exponentials, hence the crystalline site and crystals on this site.
We will then introduce the theory of Universal extensions which allows
to define some crystals associated to Barsotti-Tate groups,
which act as a generalization of the construction of the Dieudonné module.
These, together with the theory of deformation of Grothendieck-Messing,
will be used to introduce the theory of classification
of $p$-divisible groups over $O_K$ due to Kisin and Breuil.
Then, after spending some time to introduce the most relevant period rings
for the aim of this work, we will use the above-mentioned results
to construct and study the desired comparison isomorphism.



\section*{Notation and conventions}
Each time we will use the letter $p$ it is going to denote a prime number.
For convenience sake we can fix it here once and for all.
With this in mind we will denote by $\mathbb{F}_{p}$ the field with $p$ elements,
by $\mathbb{Z}$ the ring of integers and by $\mathbb{Q}_p$ and $\mathbb{Z}_{p}$
respectively the field and ring of $p$-adic numbers.
Then, for an extension $K/\mathbb{Q}_p$, we will denote by $O_K$ the ring of
integers of $K$ and by $K_0$ the maximal unramified subextension of $K/\mathbb{Q}_p$.

With regards to algebraic geometry: for a morphism of schemes $f\colon X \to Y$,
we will denote by $f^{\#}\colon \mathcal{O}_{ Y } \to f_*\mathcal{O}_{ X }$ the
associated morphism between structure sheaves and, given $y \coloneqq f(x)$,
by $f_y^{\#}\colon \mathcal{O}_{ Y,y } \to \mathcal{O}_{ X,x }$ the induced morphism
at the level of stalks.
Finally we denote by $\mathfrak{m}_x$ the maximal ideal of the local ring
$\mathcal{O}_{ X,x }$ and by $\kappa(x) \coloneqq \mathcal{O}_{ X,x }/\mathfrak{m}_x$
the residue field at $x$.

With respect to category theory:
we will not worry about universes. More precisely we will
tacitly assume a universe $\mathbb{U}$ has been chosen
and we restrict to categories whose objects lie in $\mathbb{U}$.
We will denote categories using a sans serif font.
In particular we will use the following notations:
$\mathsf{Sch}/S$ for the category of schemes over $S$,
$\mathsf{Gp}$ for that of groups,
$\mathsf{Ab}$ for that of abelian groups,
$\mathsf{Top}$ for that of topological spaces,
and $\mathsf{Sets}$ for that of sets.
Moreover, by {\em ring} or {\em algebra}, we will mean one which is commutative and with unity.
Finally we will often use the shorter $X \in \mathsf{C}$ to mean that $X$ is an object
of the category $\mathsf{C}$, i.e. that $X \in \mathrm{Ob} \left(\mathsf{C}\right)$.
