	over \texorpdfstring{$\mathcal{O}_{ K }$}{the ring of integers of K}}



\subsection{Witt vectors}
In order to work over a finite extension $K/\mathbb{Q}_p$ it is convenient to
have some familiarity with the formalism of Witt vectors, so we will dedicate some 
space to recall the basic definitions and results.


\begin{rem}[Motivation]
	Consider $K/\mathbb{Q}_p$ finite and unramified.
	Denote by $k \coloneqq O_K/pOK$ the residue field of $K$ and by $q \coloneqq \left| k \right|$
	its cardinality.
	Then there is multiplicative map $[\ \cdot \ ]\colon k \to O_K$,
	called the Teichmüller lifting, with image $\mu_{q-1}(O_K)$
	the $(q-1)$-st root of unity of $O_K$.
	In particular it is well known that any element $a \in O_K$
	can be uniquely written in a Teichmüller expansion
	\begin{equation*}
		a = \sum_{n \in \mathbb{N}} [c_n] p^n
	,\end{equation*}
	with $c_n \in k$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$.
	The theory of Witt vectors allows the explicit computation of sum and
	products between Teichmüller lifts, using only
	algebraic operations of the sequences of elements of $k$.
	Clearly its interest doesn't stop there, so we will highlight some 
	other properties of the construction.

	Moreover we wish to remark that the following constructions
	can be carried out for any ring $A$, though the most interesting
	results for us will be in case $A$ is a perfect $\mathbb{F}_p$-algebra,
	i.e. an $\mathbb{F}_p$ algebra on which the map $x \mapsto x^p$
	is an automorphism.
	Then, in this whole section we will stick to this assumption.
\end{rem}


\begin{defn}[Witt polynomials]
	We define a family of polynomials $\left\{ w_n(\mathbf{x}) \right\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}} \subset
	\mathbb{Z}[\mathbf{x}] = \mathbb{Z}[x_i]_{i \in \mathbb{N}}$ by
	\begin{align*}
		w_0(\mathbf{x}) \coloneqq w_0(x_0) &\coloneqq x_0 \\
		w_1(\mathbf{x}) \coloneqq w_1(x_0, x_1) &\coloneqq x_0^p + px_1 \\
				&\ \ \ \ \! \vdots \\
		w_n(\mathbf{x}) \coloneqq w_n(x_0, \ldots, x_n) &\coloneqq
		\sum_{ i=0 }^{ n } p^i x_i^{p^{n-1}} =
		x_0^{p^n} + px_1^{p^{n-1}} + \cdots + p^{n-1}x_{n-1}^p + p^n x_n
	.\end{align*}
\end{defn}


\begin{lem}[{\cite[Chapter II, \S6, theorem 6]{Serre}}]\label{thm:WittSumProdPolys}
	For every $\phi \in \mathbb{Z}[x,y]$ there exists a sequence
	$\left\{ \varphi_n \right\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}} \subset \mathbb{Z}[\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y}]$,
	where $\mathbf{x} = \left\{ x_n \right\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$
	and analogously for $\mathbf{y}$, such that,
	for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$,
	\begin{equation*}
		w_n(\varphi_0, \ldots, \varphi_n) =
		\phi \left( w_n(x_0, \ldots, x_n), w_n(y_0, \ldots, y_n) \right)
	.\end{equation*}
\end{lem} 


\begin{ntt}[]\label{not:WittSumProd}
	Denote by $\left\{ S_n \right\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ and
	$\left\{ P_n \right\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ the polynomials associated 
	by \cref{thm:WittSumProdPolys} to 
	$\phi(x,y) = x + y$ and $\phi(x,y) = x \cdot y$ respectively.
	Then we define, for $\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b} \in A^{\mathbb{N}}$ the following
	composition laws:
	\begin{align*}
		\mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b} &\coloneqq
		\left( S_n(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b}) \right)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}\\
		\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} &\coloneqq 
		\left( P_n(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b}) \right)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}
	.\end{align*}
\end{ntt}


\begin{thm}[{\cite[Chapter II, \S6, theorem 7]{Serre}}]
	The laws of composition on $A^{\mathbb{N}}$ defined in \cref{not:WittSumProd}
	make it into a commutative unitary ring.
\end{thm}


\begin{defn}[Ring of Witt vectors]
	We define the {\em ring of Witt vectors} with coefficients in $A$
	to be the commutative unitary ring $A^{\mathbb{N}}$ endowed with
	the composition laws defined in \cref{not:WittSumProd}.
\end{defn}


\begin{rem}[]
	By definition, the map
	\begin{equation*}
	\begin{tikzcd}[row sep = 0ex
		,/tikz/column 1/.append style={anchor=base east}
		,/tikz/column 2/.append style={anchor=base west}]
		W\colon W(A) \arrow[r, "", rightarrow] &
		A^{\mathbb{N}} \\
		\mathbf{a} \arrow[r, "", mapsto] & 
		\left( w_n(\mathbf{a}) \right)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}
	\end{tikzcd}
	\end{equation*} 
	is a ring homomorphism.
	Moreover it is easy to check that it is an isomorphism as soon
	as $p$ is invertible and it is a monomorphism if $p$ is not a zero divisor.
\end{rem}


\begin{defn}[Frobenius and Verschiebung]
	Since $A$ is of characteristic $p$ we can define on $W(A)$ the following two
	maps
	\begin{equation*}
	\begin{tikzcd}[row sep = 0ex
		,/tikz/column 1/.append style={anchor=base east}
		,/tikz/column 2/.append style={anchor=base west}]
		V\colon W(A) \arrow[r, "", rightarrow] &
		W(A) \\
		(a_0, a_1, \ldots) \arrow[r, "", mapsto] & 
		(0, a_0, a_1, \ldots)
	\end{tikzcd}
	\qquad \text{ and } \qquad
	\begin{tikzcd}[row sep = 0ex
		,/tikz/column 1/.append style={anchor=base east}
		,/tikz/column 2/.append style={anchor=base west}]
		F\colon W(A) \arrow[r, "", rightarrow] &
		W(A) \\
		(a_0, a_1, \ldots) \arrow[r, "", mapsto] & 
		(a_0^p, a_1^p, \ldots)
	.\end{tikzcd}
	\end{equation*} 
	It can be easily shown that the first map, called {\em Verschiebung}
	(German for {\em shift}), is additive, whereas the second, called {\em Frobenius},
	is a ring homomorphism.
\end{defn}


\begin{defn}[]
	A ring $B$ is called {\em $p$-ring} iff it is separated and complete
	for the topology induced by a decreasing collection of ideals
	$\left\{ \mathfrak{b}_i \right\}_{i \geq 1}$ such that for all $n,m \geq 1$
	$\mathfrak{b}_n \mathfrak{b}_m \subset \mathfrak{b}_{n+m}$ and
	$B/\mathfrak{b}_1$ is a perfect $\mathbb{F}_p$-algebra
	(hence $p \in \mathfrak{b}_1$).

	We say that $B$ is a {\em strict $p$-ring} iff it is a $p$-ring
	and $\mathfrak{b}_i = p^iB$ for all $i \geq 1$
	and $p\colon B \to B$ is an injective map.
\end{defn}


\begin{rem}[]
	Notice that a strict $p$-ring is a $p$-adically separated and complete
	ring such that $B/pB$ is a perfect $\mathbb{F}_p$-algebra.
\end{rem}


\begin{rem}[]
	Since $A$ is of characteristic $p$ we have the identities
	$VF = FV = p$.
	Moreover, in case $A$ is perfect, we see that $p^nW(A) = V^nW(A)$,
	since
	\begin{equation*}
		p \cdot \left( a_0, a_1, \ldots \right) =
		(0, a_0^p, a_1^p, \ldots)
	.\end{equation*}
	This means that the $p$-adic topology of $W(A)$ corresponds
	to the natural product topology.
	This means that $W(A) \simeq \varprojlim_{n \in \mathbb{N}} W(A)/ (p^n)$
	hence that $W(A)$ is a strict $p$-ring.
\end{rem}


\begin{prop}[{\cite[Proposition 4.2.3]{Brinon}}]
	If $A$ is a perfect $\mathbb{F}_p$-algebra and $B$ is a $p$-ring,
	then the natural "reduction" map 
	\begin{equation*}
	\begin{tikzcd}
		\mathrm{Hom}_{  } \left( W(A), B \right)
		\arrow[r, "\sim", rightarrow] &
		\mathrm{Hom}_{  } \left( A, B/\mathfrak{b}_1 \right)
	\end{tikzcd}
	\end{equation*}
	is an isomorphism.
	More generally, for any strict $p$-ring $\mathcal{B}$, the natural map
	\begin{equation*}
	\begin{tikzcd}
		\mathrm{Hom}_{  } \left( \mathcal{B}, B \right)
		\arrow[r, "\sim", rightarrow] &
		\mathrm{Hom}_{  } \left( \mathcal{B}/ (p), B/\mathfrak{b}_1 \right)
	\end{tikzcd}
	\end{equation*}
	is bijective for every $p$-ring $B$.
\end{prop}


\begin{rem}[]\leavevmode\vspace{-.2\baselineskip}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Let's notice that, by the previous comments, we have
	$W(A)/ (p) = A$, which allows the definition of the first map above.
	Moreover the above shows that $\mathcal{B}$ and $W(\mathcal{B}/p \mathcal{B})$
	satisfy the same universal property in the category of $p$-rings.
	As a consequence all strict $p$-rings are of the form $W(A)$ for
	a perfect $\mathbb{F}_p$-algebra $A$.

\item Using the above proposition we can recover the theory of maximal unramified
	extensions for finite extensions $K/\mathbb{Q}_p$.
	Let $k \coloneqq O_k/ (\pi_K)$ be its residue field.
	In fact $O_K$ is a $p$-ring, when considered with the filtration
	given by $\left\{ \pi_K^i \right\}_{i \geq 1}$.
	Then there is a unique map of rings $\alpha\colon W(k) \to O_K$
	lifting the isomorphism $W(k)/ (p) \simeq k \simeq O_K/ (\pi_K)$.
	Since $p$ has image in the maximal ideal of $O_K$,
	the map $\alpha$ is local and injective.
	This means that $O_K/ (p)$ is a $W(k)/ (p) = k$ vector space
	with basis $\left(1, \pi_K, \ldots, \pi_K^e\right)$,
	where $e = e(K/\mathbb{Q}_p)$ is the absolute ramification
	index of $K$.
	Since $O_K$ is complete and separated with respect to the $p$-adic topology,
	by successive approximations, we see that the above is a
	$W(k)$-basis of $O_K$, which is then a free $W(k)$-module
	of rank $e$.
	As a consequence also $K = O_K[1/p]$ is a $W(k)[1/p] \eqqcolon K_0$
	vector space of dimension $e$.
	Then $K/K_0$ is a field extension of degree $e$, which is totally ramified
	since the two fields have isomorphic residue fields.
	Then we see that the Witt vector construction allows one to
	construct $K_0$ the {\em maximal unramified subextension} of any
	finite extension of $\mathbb{Q}_p$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{rem}



\subsection{Classification of \texorpdfstring{$p$}{p}-divisible groups
	over \texorpdfstring{$\mathcal{O}_{ K }$}{the ring of integers of K}}
This section will follow \cite[Appendix A]{Kisin}.
We fix $k$ a perfect field of characteristic $p$,
$W \coloneqq W(k)$ its ring of Witt vectors, $K_0 \coloneqq W[1/p]$
its field of fractions and $K/K_0$ a finite totally ramified extension.
Fix now a uniformizer $\pi$ of $K$ with (Eisenstein) minimal polynomial
$E(u) \in K_0[u]$.


\begin{rem}[]
	The formation of $\mathbb{D}(G)$ and of $\mathbb{D}^*(G)$ is compatible
	with all base changes. %(tk: why?).
	In particular, if $p = 0$ on $T$ we can pull $G$ back by the Frobenius $\varphi$ on $T$.
	Then the relative Frobenius on $G$ gives a map $G \to \varphi^*(G)$
	hence a map of crystals
	\begin{equation*}
	\begin{tikzcd}
		\varphi^* (\mathbb{D}^*(G)) \arrow[r, "\sim", rightarrow] &
		\mathbb{D}^*(\varphi^*(G)) \arrow[r, "", rightarrow] &
		\mathbb{D}^*(G)
	.\end{tikzcd}
	\end{equation*}
\end{rem}


\begin{ntt}[]
	In the following we will mainly be interested in the valuation of
	crystals on objects.
	In particular, given $G_0 \in \mathsf{BT}(T_0)$ and 
	$T_0 \hookrightarrow T \in \mathsf{Crys}(T_0)$, we will be interested
	in $\mathbb{D}^*(G_0)_{T}(T) = \mathbb{D}^*(G_0)_{T_0 \hookrightarrow T}(T)$,
	where $\mathbb{D}^*(G_0)_T$ is defined in \cref{CrystalAssociatedZarSheafS}
	and its evaluation in \cref{rem:SheavesCrysX}.
	Then we introduce the shorter notation
	$\mathbb{D}^*(G_0)(T) \coloneqq \mathbb{D}^*(G_0)_T(T)$.
	Finally, if $T = \mathrm{Spec}(A)$ is affine, we introduce the notation
	$\mathbb{D}^*(G)(A)$ for $\mathbb{D}^*(G)(T)$.
\end{ntt}


\begin{rem}[]\label{rem:DGValuationRestriction}
	Suppose that $T_0$ is a scheme over $W$ and that $p = 0$ on $T_0$.
	Consider $G_0 \in \mathsf{BT}(T_0)$ and $T_0 \hookrightarrow T \in \mathsf{Crys}(T_0/W)$
	an object on which $p$ is locally nilpotent, and $G$ a lifting of $G_0$ to $T$.
	By construction of $\mathbb{D}^*$ we have an isomorphism
	\begin{equation*}
	\begin{tikzcd}[row sep = 0ex
		,/tikz/column 1/.append style={anchor=base east}
		,/tikz/column 2/.append style={anchor=base west}]
		\mathbb{D}^*(G_0)(T) \arrow[r, "\sim", rightarrow] &
		\mathbb{D}^*(G)(T)
	.\end{tikzcd}
	\end{equation*} 
	%In fact, as defined above, the left hand side is just
	%$\mathbb{D}^*(G_0)_{T_0 \hookrightarrow T}(T)$ and the right hand side
	%$\mathbb{D}^*(G)_{T \hookrightarrow T}(T)$.
	%Then it suffices to prove the equality of Zariski sheaves on $T$
	%\begin{equation*}
	%\mathbb{D}^*(G_0)_{T_0 \hookrightarrow T} = \mathbb{D}^*(G)_{T \hookrightarrow T}
	%.\end{equation*}
	%In fact, in general, a nilpotent closed immersion $U_0 \hookrightarrow U$
	%induces a morphism $\mathsf{Crys}(U/S) \to \mathsf{Crys}(U_0/S)$
	%by base changing $T \to U$ an open immersion to $U_0$.

	Moreover the $\mathcal{O}_{ T }$-module $\mathbb{D}^*(G)(T)$ sits in an exact sequence
	\begin{equation*}
	\begin{tikzcd}
		0 \arrow[r, "", rightarrow] &
		\left( \mathrm{Lie}(G) \right)^D \arrow[r, "", rightarrow] &
		\mathbb{D}^*(G)(T) \arrow[r, "", rightarrow] &
		\mathrm{Lie}(G^D) \arrow[r, "", rightarrow] &
		0
	.\end{tikzcd}
	\end{equation*}
\end{rem}


\noindent
We recall that elements of $\mathsf{Crys}(X/S)$ are defined by
locally nilpotent sheaf of ideals.
In what follows, though, we want to evaluate crystals on
surjections of $p$-adically complete rings, whose kernel is endowed with divided powers.
\begin{defn}[]\label{defn:NotNilpotentEvaluation}
	tk: this definition seems to make sense, but I wrote it myself.
	Let $A \twoheadrightarrow A_0$ be a surjective homomorphism
	of $p$-adically complete and separated $\mathbb{Z}_{p}$-algebras
	whose kernel is equipped with divided powers, compatible with those on $p \mathbb{Z}_{p}$.
	Take $G \in \mathsf{BT}(A_0)$.
	Denote by $G_n$ the restriction of $G$ to $A_0/p^nA_0$
	and by $A_n \coloneqq A/p^nA$.
	Then we define
	\begin{equation*}
		\mathbb{D}^*(G)(A) \coloneqq
		\varprojlim_{n \in \mathbb{N}} \mathbb{D}^*(G_n)(A_n)
	.\end{equation*}
\end{defn}


\begin{rem}[]
	Notice that, in the above definition, $A_n \twoheadrightarrow A_0/p^nA_0$
	has kernel equipped with divided powers.
	In fact it is the projection of the kernel of $A \twoheadrightarrow A_0$, over
	$p^nA$, an ideal with divided powers compatible with those on the kernel.
	And analogously, since the divided powers on the kernel are compatible with those 
	on $(p)$, we see that the kernel of $A_n \twoheadrightarrow A_0/p^mA_0$
	has divided powers for all $m \leq n$.
	Now, combining this remark with \cref{rem:DGValuationRestriction},
	we see that the above definition could have easily been swapped out with
	\begin{equation*}
		\mathbb{D}^*(G)(A) \coloneqq
		\varprojlim_{n \geq m} \mathbb{D}^*(G_m)(A_n)
	\end{equation*}
	by cofinality of the family $n \geq m$ in $\mathbb{N}$.
\end{rem}


\begin{rem}[]
	We will now introduce some technical lemmas, which will play a crucial role
	in the proof of the main result of this section, \cref{prop:A6Kisin}.
	In fact these lemmas allow, in combination with \cref{thm:EquivCatBTS},
	to lift not only a Barsotti-Tate group along a thickening with divided
	powers, but also to lift some additional structure, i.e.
	a Frobenius morphism and a filtration, on the valuation of $\mathbb{D}^*$.
	This will be needed in the proof to iteratively lift the
	Barsotti-Tate group over $k$ obtained via the classical classification,
	along with all the extra required structure, to an object of $\mathsf{BT}(O_K)$.
\end{rem}


\begin{lem}[{\cite[Lemma A.2]{Kisin}}]\label{lem:A2Kisin}
	Let $A \to A_0$ be a surjection of $p$-adically complete
	and separated local $\mathbb{Z}_{p}$-algebras with residue field
	$k$ and kernel $\mathrm{Fil}^1 A$ equipped with divided powers.
	Suppose moreover that
\begin{enumerate}
	\item $A$ is $p$-torsion-free and it is equipped with an endomorphism
		$\varphi\colon A \to A$ lifting the Frobenius on $A/pA$;
		
	\item the following map, induced on the pullback, is surjective
		\begin{equation*}
		\begin{tikzcd}
			\mathrm{id}_{ A } \otimes \varphi/p \colon
			\varphi^*(\mathrm{Fil}^1 A)
			\arrow[r, "", twoheadrightarrow] &
			A
		.\end{tikzcd}
		\end{equation*}
\end{enumerate}
	If $G \in \mathsf{BT}(A_0)$ we write $\mathrm{Fil}^1 \mathbb{D}^*(G)(A) \subset \mathbb{D}^*(G)(A)$
	for the preimage of $\left( \mathrm{Lie}(G) \right)^D$ inside $\mathbb{D}^*(G)(A_0)$.
	Then the restriction of $\varphi\colon \mathbb{D}^*(G)(A) \to \mathbb{D}^*(G)(A)$
	to $\mathrm{Fil}^1 \mathbb{D}^*(G)(A)$ is divisible by $p$ and the following induced map
	is a surjection
	\begin{equation*}
	\begin{tikzcd}
		1 \otimes \varphi/p \colon
		\varphi^*\mathrm{Fil}^1 \mathbb{D}^*(G)(A)
		\arrow[r, "", twoheadrightarrow] &
		\mathbb{D}^*(G)(A)
	.\end{tikzcd}
	\end{equation*}
\end{lem} 


\begin{rem}[]\label{rem:A2Kisin}
	Even though we will not prove the theorem, we feel it is important to remark on
	the most important points used in the proof.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Given an ideal with divided powers $I \triangleleft A$, then $\varphi(I) \subset pA$.
		In fact 
		\begin{equation*}
			\varphi(x) = x^p = \gamma_p(x) \cdot p! \in pA
		.\end{equation*}

	\item Let $\widetilde{G}$ be a lift of $G$ to $A$, then we have
		\begin{equation*}
			\mathrm{Fil}^1(\mathbb{D}^*(\widetilde{G})(A) =
			( \mathrm{Lie} \widetilde{G} )^D +
			\mathrm{Fil}^1A \cdot \mathbb{D}^*(\widetilde{G})(A)
		.\end{equation*}
		
	\item Let $H \in \mathsf{BT}(\mathrm{Spec}(W(k))$. Denote by $H_0$ the restriction
		of $H$ to $k$ and by $V$ the Verschiebung morphism.
		Then $W(k) \twoheadrightarrow k$ satisfies the hypothesis of our lemma,
		and the kernel $\mathrm{Fil}^1(W(k)) = (p)$ is equipped with divided powers.
		Then, using the theory of Dieudonné modules, one can see that
		\begin{equation*}
			( \mathrm{Lie} H)^D + p \mathbb{D}^*(H)(W(k)) =
			V \mathbb{D}^{*}(H)(W(k))
		,\end{equation*}
		i.e. that
		$V \mathbb{D}^*(H)(W(k)) = \mathrm{Fil}^1 \mathbb{D}^*(H)(W(k))$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{rem}


\begin{defn}[Special ring]
	We define a {\em special ring} to be a $p$-adically complete, separated, $p$-torsion-free,
	local $\mathbb{Z}_{p}$-algebra $A$ equipped with an endomorphism $\varphi$
	lifting the Frobenius on $A/pA$.
	Moreover we call {\em map of special rings} a morphism
	of $\mathbb{Z}_{p}$-algebras compatible with $\varphi$.
\end{defn}


\begin{defn}[]
	Let $A$ be a special ring. We define the category
	$\mathsf{C}_A$ whose objects are finite, free $A$-modules
	$M$ equipped with a semilinear Frobenius map $\varphi\colon M \to M$
	and an $A$-submodule $M_1 \subset M$ such that $\varphi(M_1) \subset pM$
	and such that the map
	\begin{equation*}
	\begin{tikzcd}[row sep = 0ex
		,/tikz/column 1/.append style={anchor=base east}
		,/tikz/column 2/.append style={anchor=base west}]
		\mathrm{id}_{ A }\otimes\varphi/p\colon 
		\varphi^*(M_1) \arrow[r, "", twoheadrightarrow] &
		M
	\end{tikzcd}
	\end{equation*} 
	is surjective.
	Its morphisms are morphisms of $A$-modules compatible with
	the Frobenius and submodules.
\end{defn}


\begin{rem}[]
	Notice that \cref{lem:A2Kisin} allows to endow,
	for $G \in \mathsf{BT}(A_0)$ and $A \twoheadrightarrow A_0$ as in the hypothesis,
	the module $\mathbb{D}^*(G)(A)$ with the structure of an object in $\mathsf{C}_A$.
\end{rem}


\begin{defn}[]
	Consider a map of special rings $A \to B$ and $M \in \mathsf{C}_A$.
	Then $M \otimes_A B \in \mathsf{C}_B$, when equipped with
	the induced Frobenius %(tk: what is it?) 
	and setting
	$\left( M \otimes_A B \right)_1$ to be the image of
	$M_1 \otimes_A B$ in $M \otimes_A B$.
\end{defn}


\begin{lem}[{\cite[Lemma A.4]{Kisin}}]\label{lem:A4Kisin}
	Let $h\colon A \to B$ be a surjection of special rings with kernel $J$.
	Suppose that, for all $i \geq 1$, $\varphi^i(J) \subset p^{i + j_i} J$,
	where $\left\{ j_i \right\}_{i \geq 1}$ is a sequence of integers
	such that $\lim_{i \to \infty} j_i = \infty$.
	Consider $M, M' \in \mathsf{C}_A$ and
	\begin{equation*}
	\begin{tikzcd}[row sep = 0ex
		,/tikz/column 1/.append style={anchor=base east}
		,/tikz/column 2/.append style={anchor=base west}]
		\theta_B\colon M \otimes_A B 
		\arrow[r, "\sim", rightarrow] &
		M' \otimes_A B
	\end{tikzcd}
	\end{equation*} 
	an isomorphism in $\mathsf{C}_B$.
	Then there exists a unique isomorphism of $A$-modules
	$\theta_A\colon M \to M'$ lifting $\theta_B$ and compatible with $\varphi$.
\end{lem} 


\begin{rem}[]
	Again we will not prove the theorem, though try to give an idea of
	how the proof works.
	In this case we deform iteratively the map
	\begin{equation*}
	\begin{tikzcd}[column sep=4.8em]
		\varphi^*(M_1) \arrow[r, "\varphi^*(\left.\theta_0\right|_{ M_1 })", rightarrow] &
		\varphi^*(M_1') \arrow[r, "1 \otimes \varphi/p", rightarrow] &
		M'
	\end{tikzcd}
	\end{equation*}
	obtaining a succession of maps $\theta_i$ whose successive difference
	has image lying in $p^{j_i}M'$.
	The fact that $j_i \to \infty$ allows to obtain a well defined limit.
\end{rem}


\noindent
In order to apply the above results to the proof of the main theorem of the section
we still need some remarks and definitions.


\begin{ntt}[]
	Consider $W$ as a divided power ring, endowing the maximal ideal $(p)$
	with the divided powers structure defined in \cref{PDex:DVR} of \cref{PDexamples}.
	Consider $W[u]$ as a $W$-algebra, and take $\mathcal{D}_{W[u]}(E(u))$
	its divided powers envelope, as outlined in \cref{thm:PDEnvelope}.
	Let's notice that, as outlined in \cref{rem:PDEnvelope},
	the ideal $\overline{J}$ of $\mathcal{D}_{W[u]}(E(u))$ contains $p$.
	We denote by $S$ the $p$-adic completion of $\mathcal{D}_{W[u]}(E(u))$.
	The ring $S$ is equipped with an endomorphism $\varphi$ given by the Frobenius
	on $W$ and by $\varphi(u) \coloneqq u^p$.
	We denote by $\mathrm{Fil}^1 S \subset S$ the closure of the ideal
	generated by $E(u)$ and its divided powers.
	Since $\mathrm{Fil}^1(S)$ is equipped with divided powers, 
	as seen in \cref{rem:A2Kisin} we have $\varphi( \mathrm{Fil}^1 S) \subset p S$.
	Then we set $\varphi_1 \coloneqq \varphi/p$.
\end{ntt}


\begin{rem}[]\label{rem:j_iTheoremA6}
	We will apply \cref{lem:A4Kisin} in the situation where $J$ is equipped
	with divided powers structure and there exists a finite set of 
	elements $x_1, \ldots, x_n \in J$ such that $J$, in the $p$-adic topology, 
	is topologically generated by the $x_i$ and their divided powers.
	We will have, moreover, that $\varphi(x_i) = x_1^p$.
	Then the integers $j_i$ above are $v_p \left( (p-1)! \right) - 1$.
	In fact, since $J$ is equipped with divided powers, we have
	\begin{equation*}
		\varphi^i(x_j) =
		x_j^{p^i} =
		x_j \cdot \gamma_{p^i-1}(x_j) \cdot (p^i-1)!
	.\end{equation*}
	Since both $x_j$ and $\gamma_{p^i-1}(x_j)$ are in $J$,
	we see that $\varphi^i(x_j) \in p^{\nu_p((p^i-1)!)}J$.
\end{rem}


\begin{defn}[]
	We denote by $\mathsf{BT}^{\varphi}_{/S}$ the category
	whose objects are finite free $S$-modules $M$
	equipped with an $S$-submodule $\mathrm{Fil}^1 M$
	and a $\varphi$-semilinear map $\varphi_1\colon  \mathrm{Fil}^1 M \to M$
	such that
\begin{enumerate}
	\item $\mathrm{Fil}^1 S \cdot M \subset \mathrm{Fil}^1 M$
		and the quotient $M/\mathrm{Fil}^1 M$ is a free $\mathcal{O}_{ K }$-module;
	\item the map $1 \otimes \varphi_1\colon 
		\varphi^* \left( \mathrm{Fil}^1 M \right) \to M$
		is surjective.
\end{enumerate}
\end{defn}


\begin{rem}[]\label{invertibilityphi1E(u))}
	Notice that any $M \in \mathsf{BT}^{\varphi}_{/S}$ is equipped with a 
	$\varphi$-semilinear map $\varphi\colon M \to M$ defined by
	\begin{equation*}
		\varphi (x) \coloneqq \varphi_1 \left( E(u) \right)^{-1} \varphi_1 (E(u)x)
	.\end{equation*}
	In fact $\varphi_1(E(u))$ is invertible in $S$.
	To show this we recall that, by definition, $\varphi_1$ is
	linear on $W[u]$, and that $W[u]$ embeds in $S$.
	Then it is enough to show that the element
	\begin{equation*}
		\varphi_1(E(u)) =
		\frac{ u^{ep} }{ p } + \varphi_1(a_{e-1}) u^{(e-1)p} +
		\cdots + \varphi_1(a_0)
	\end{equation*}
	is invertible in $W[u]$.
	Recall that,
	for all $L/K_0$ finite and totally ramified,
	the following morphism is surjective 
	\begin{equation*}
	\begin{tikzcd}[row sep = 0ex
		,/tikz/column 1/.append style={anchor=base east}
		,/tikz/column 2/.append style={anchor=base west}]
		W[u] \arrow[r, "", twoheadrightarrow] &
		O_{L} \\
		u \arrow[r, "", mapsto] & 
		\pi_L
	.\end{tikzcd}
	\end{equation*} 
	This is because, as an $O_{K_0}$-module, $O_L$ is generated by $\pi_L$, its uniformizer,
	and every element of $W$ can be seen as an element in $O_{K_0}$.
	Let's now take $[ L : K_0 ] = e \cdot p$, where $e = [ K : K_0 ]$.
	Then the image of $\varphi_1(E(u))$ via the above morphism is given by a sum of
	elements with strictly positive valuation 
	(we have $\nu_L(\varphi_1(a_i)) > 0$ for all $i < e$) and $\pi_L^{ep}/p$.
	Since the absolute ramification of $L$ is exactly $ep$, we see that this
	last term is invertible, hence the whole sum is.
	By surjectivity $\varphi_1(E(u))$ is invertible also in $W[u]$,
	hence in $S$.
\end{rem}


\begin{prop}[{\cite[Proposition A.6]{Kisin}}]\label{prop:A6Kisin}
	There is an exact contravariant functor
	\begin{equation*}
	\begin{tikzcd}[row sep = 0ex
		,/tikz/column 1/.append style={anchor=base east}
		,/tikz/column 2/.append style={anchor=base west}]
		\mathsf{BT}(\mathcal{O}_{ K }) \arrow[r, "", rightarrow] &
		\mathsf{BT}^{\varphi}_{/S} \\
		G \arrow[r, "", mapsto] & 
		\mathbb{D}^*(G)(S)
	.\end{tikzcd}
	\end{equation*} 
	If $p > 2$ this functor is an anti equivalence,
	whereas if $p = 2$ it induces an anti-equivalence of the 
	corresponding isogeny categories.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}\leavevmode\vspace{-.2\baselineskip}
We start by showing that this functor actually takes values in $\mathsf{BT}^{\varphi}_{/S}$.
To do so we need to show that $M(G) \coloneqq \mathbb{D}^{*}(G)(S)$
has a structure of object in $\mathsf{BT}^{\varphi}_{/S}$.
If we can show that $S$ and $O_K$ satisfy the hypothesis of \cref{lem:A2Kisin}
we can conclude by invoking that result.
Notice that the map $S \to O_K$ is induced by $W[u] \twoheadrightarrow O_K$
which we already remarked being a surjection.
Then, by construction, we see that $S \twoheadrightarrow O_K$
is surjective too.
Then it is clear that both $S$ and $O_K$ are 
$p$-adically complete, separated, local $\mathbb{Z}_{p}$-algebras.
Moreover, by definition, $\ker (W[u] \to O_K) = (E(u))$.
Then, by construction of $S$ and completeness of $O_K$,
we see that $\mathrm{Fil}^1 S$, the kernel of $S \twoheadrightarrow O_K$, is generated
by $E(u)$ and its divided powers.
Then, thanks to \cref{PDExtendCompletion} it is equipped with divided powers.
Moreover, by construction, it is clear that $S$ is $p$-torsion-free
and it is also equipped with an endomorphism lifting the Frobenius on $S/pS$.

Finally we are left to prove that the map
\begin{equation*}
\begin{tikzcd}[row sep = 0ex
	,/tikz/column 1/.append style={anchor=base east}
	,/tikz/column 2/.append style={anchor=base west}]
	\mathrm{id}_{ S } \otimes \varphi/p \colon 
	\varphi^*(\mathrm{Fil}^1 S) \arrow[r, "", twoheadrightarrow] &
	S
\end{tikzcd}
\end{equation*} 
is surjective.
Here, thanks to the argument in \cref{invertibilityphi1E(u))}, we easily conclude.
In fact we see that, for all $s \in S$,
\begin{equation*}
\begin{tikzcd}[row sep = 0ex
	,/tikz/column 1/.append style={anchor=base east}
	,/tikz/column 2/.append style={anchor=base west}]
	s \cdot \left( \varphi_1(E(u)) \right)^{-1} \otimes E(u) 
	\arrow[r, "", mapsto] & 
	s
.\end{tikzcd}
\end{equation*} 


The converse is definitely more tricky and we will only concentrate on
the case $p > 2$, leaving the rest of the proof to \cite{Kisin}.
It will require the use of classical Dieudonné theory to construct a
Barsotti-Tate group over $k$ associated to a module $M \in \mathsf{BT}^{\varphi}_{/S}$
and then to iteratively lift it from $k = O_K/\pi O_K$ to $O_K$.
This difficulty is due to the fact that, in general, the maximal
ideal of $O_K$, i.e. the kernel of $O_K \twoheadrightarrow k$, 
does not admit divided powers.
Then the only hope to lift the classical construction is to
procede iteratively, reducing the above projection to a sequence of
smaller projections, whose kernels all have divided powers structures.

More specifically, using the previous technical lemmas and Grothendieck-Messing deformation theory,
we will iteratively lift $G_1$, the Barsotti-Tate group coming from calssical Dieudonné theory,
to $G_i \in \mathsf{BT}(O_K/\pi^iO_K)$ until $i = e$.
Finally, thanks to completeness of $O_K$ and \cite[Lemma 2.4.4]{deJong},
we will carry out another inductive process of lifting
to define $G \in \mathsf{BT}(O_K)$.
The idea is that at each step we obtain a group with an isomorphism
\begin{equation*}
\begin{tikzcd}[row sep = 0ex
	,/tikz/column 1/.append style={anchor=base east}
	,/tikz/column 2/.append style={anchor=base west}]
	\mathbb{D}^*(G_i)(R_i) \arrow[r, "\sim", rightarrow] &
	M_i
\end{tikzcd}
\end{equation*} 
compatible with both filtration and $\varphi$, in such a way that these isomorphisms
lift to a global one, still compatible with all the necessary structure.

Let's now start the proof proper, by introducing the necessary notation:
let $i$ vary in $1, \ldots, e$ and set $R_i \coloneqq W[u]/u^i$.
Clearly $R_i$ is equipped with a Frobenius endomorphism $\varphi$
given by the usual one on $W$ and $u \mapsto u^p$ on the indeterminate.
Then $O_K/ (\pi^i)$ is an $R_i$-algebra by $u \mapsto \pi$,
seeing $W = O_{K_0} \subset O_K$.
As can be seen writing the elements of $O_K$ in Teichmüller expansion
the map $R_i \twoheadrightarrow O_K/ (\pi^i)$ is a surjection
with kernel $pR_i$, which is equipped with divided powers by \cref{lem:PDFlatExtension}.
Then, given a $p$-divisible group $G_i \in \mathsf{BT}(O_K/\pi^iO_K)$,
we can evaluate $\mathbb{D}^*(G_i)(R_i)$ thanks to \cref{defn:NotNilpotentEvaluation}.
Following the notation of \cref{lem:A2Kisin}
we denote by $\mathrm{Fil}^1\mathbb{D}^*(G_i)(R_i)$
the preimage of $\left( \mathrm{Lie}G_i \right)^D \subset \mathbb{D}^*(G_i)(O_K/\pi^iO_K)$
in $\mathbb{D}^*(G_i)(R_i)$.
Notice that universal property of divided powers envelope
induces a $\varphi$-compatible map $S \to R_i$ as the unique map associated to
\begin{equation*}
\begin{tikzcd}[row sep = 0ex
	,/tikz/column 1/.append style={anchor=base east}
	,/tikz/column 2/.append style={anchor=base west}]
	W[u] \arrow[r, "", rightarrow] &
	R_i \\
	u \arrow[r, "", mapsto] & u \\
	u^{ej} / j!  \arrow[r, "", mapsto] & 0
.\end{tikzcd}
\end{equation*} 
This map is compatible with $\varphi$, hence by uniqueness also
the induced map on $S$ is.
We can then define the module $M_i \coloneqq M \otimes_S R_i$,
which is a restriction of scalars of our original one and
it is also equipped with the diagonal action of $\varphi$.
We set $\mathrm{Fil}^1 M_i \subset M_i$
to be the image of $\mathrm{Fil}^1 M$ in $M_i$, which is a submodule
by surjectivity of $S \twoheadrightarrow R_i$.
Notice that the above corresponds to defining $\mathrm{Fil}^1 M_i \coloneqq
\mathrm{Fil}^1 M \otimes_S R_i$.
Then, by right exactness of tensor product, 
\begin{equation*}
\begin{tikzcd}[row sep = 0ex
	,/tikz/column 1/.append style={anchor=base east}
	,/tikz/column 2/.append style={anchor=base west}]
	\mathrm{id}_{ S } \otimes \varphi_1
	\colon 
	\varphi^*(\mathrm{Fil}^1 M)\arrow[r, "", rightarrow] &
	M
\end{tikzcd}
\end{equation*} 
induces an surjective map $\varphi^*(\mathrm{Fil}^1 M_i) \twoheadrightarrow M_i$
for all $i$.
In other words we have just seen that, for $i \in [1,e]$,
$M_i \in \mathsf{C}_{R_i}$.

With all this in mind we can start with the lifting process.
\begin{enumerate}
\item	At first we need to construct, using Classical Dieudonné theory,
	a barsotti-Tate group $G_1$ on $k = O_K/\pi O_k$ from $M_1$.
	Let's denote by $F\colon M_1 \to M_1$ the map induced by
	$\varphi\colon M \to M$.
	Then we see that both sides of the surjective map
	$\varphi^* ( \mathrm{Fil}^1 M_1) \to M_1$ are free $W$-modules of the same (finite) rank,
	which can be seen by base changing to $k$, which means that the map is an isomorphism.
	Now we consider the composition
	\begin{equation*}
	\begin{tikzcd}
		M_1 \arrow[r, "\sim", rightarrow] &
		\varphi^* (\mathrm{Fil}^1 M) \arrow[r, "", rightarrow] &
		\varphi^* (M_1) \arrow[r, "\sim", rightarrow] &
		M_1
	,\end{tikzcd}
	\end{equation*}
	where the first arrow is just the inverse of the above iso, the second map
	is induced by the inclusion $\mathrm{Fil}^1 M \hookrightarrow M$ and the
	third one is given by $a \otimes m \mapsto \varphi^{-1}(a)m$.
	This composition gives a $\varphi^{-1}$-semilinear map $V\colon M_1 \to M_1$
	such that $FV = VF = p$.
	Let's denote by $G_1$ the Barsotti-Tate group on $k$ associated to this
	Dieudonné module.
	Classical theory grants that the isomorphism
	\begin{equation*}
	\begin{tikzcd}[row sep = 0ex
		,/tikz/column 1/.append style={anchor=base east}
		,/tikz/column 2/.append style={anchor=base west}]
		\mathbb{D}^*(G_1)(W) \arrow[r, "\sim", rightarrow] &
		M_1
	\end{tikzcd}
	\end{equation*} 
	is compatible with Frobenius.
	Moreover, thanks to \cref{rem:A2Kisin}, $\mathrm{Fil}^1 \mathbb{D}^*(G_1)(W)$
	can be identified with $V \mathbb{D}^*(G_1)(W)$, which grants that the isomorphism
	is also compatible with Filtration.

\item We now have to start, iteratively, lift this construction.
	We assume, for $i \in [2,e]$, that we have an isomorphism
	\begin{equation}\label{eqn:PartialIsoCRi}
	\begin{tikzcd}
	\mathbb{D}^*(G_{i-1})(R_{i-1}) 
	\arrow[r, "\sim", rightarrow] &
	M_{i-1}
	\end{tikzcd}
	\end{equation}
	compatible with Frobenius and filtrations, i.e. a morphism in $\mathsf{C}_{R_{i-1}}$.
	Moreover we can notice that the kernel of $R_i \twoheadrightarrow O_K/ (\pi^{i-1})$
	is $(p, u^{i-1})$ which is still equipped with divided powers.
	In fact we simply put $\gamma_1(u^{i-1}) = u^{i-1}$ and, for all $n \geq 2$,
	$\gamma_n(u^{i-1}) = 0$, since $u^{n(i-1)} \in (u^i)$.
	Then we are done invoking \cref{lem:PDExt2}.
	Again, this means that we can compute $\mathbb{D}^*(G_{i-1})(R_i)$.
	We have already seen that $M_i \in \mathsf{C}_{R_i}$, moreover \cref{lem:A2Kisin}
	applied to the surjection $R_i \twoheadrightarrow O_k/ (\pi^{i-1})$ implies that
	also $\mathbb{D}^*(G_{i-1})(R_i)$ is in $\mathsf{C}_{R_i}$.
	Recalling that the isomorphism in \cref{eqn:PartialIsoCRi}
	is a morphism in $\mathsf{C}_{R_{i-1}}$ and \cref{rem:j_iTheoremA6}, 
	we can apply \cref{lem:A4Kisin} to the surjection $R_i \twoheadrightarrow R_{i-1}$
	and obtain a lift to an isomorphism
	\begin{equation*}
	\begin{tikzcd}
	\mathbb{D}^*(G_{i-1})(R_{i}) 
	\arrow[r, "\sim", rightarrow] &
	M_{i}
	\end{tikzcd}
	\end{equation*}
	compatible with Frobenius.
	Finally, since the kernel of $R_i \twoheadrightarrow R_{i-1}$ is nilpotent,
	we can invoke \cref{thm:EquivCatBTS} and obtain that
	there is a unique $G_i \in \mathsf{BT}(O_K/\pi^iO_K)$
	lifting $G_{i-1}$ and such that $(\mathrm{Lie}G_i)^D \subset \mathbb{D}^*(G_{i-1})(O_K/\pi^i O_K)$
	is equal to the image of $\mathrm{Fil}^i M_i$ under the composite
	%tk: here one should also prove that this image is locally free.
	%I guess this is true, since we have the short exact sequence
	%of the second rem of this section, and it should be that Lie is free
	%(then splitting, etc).
	\begin{equation*}
	\begin{tikzcd}
		\mathrm{Fil}^1 M_i \subset M_i
		\arrow[r, "\sim", rightarrow] &
		\mathbb{D}^*(G_{i-1})(R_i)
		\arrow[r, "", rightarrow] &
		\mathbb{D}^*(G_{i-1})(O_K/\pi^iO_K)
	.\end{tikzcd}
	\end{equation*}
	Then, by construction, we obtain that the isomorphism
	$\mathbb{D}^*(G_i)(R_i) \simeq M_i$, where we recall the implicit use of 
	\cref{rem:DGValuationRestriction}, is compatible also with filtrations,
	i.e. is in $\mathsf{C}_{R_i}$.
	This concludes the first step of induction.

\item Finally we need to reiterate the above argument to the surjection
	$S \twoheadrightarrow R_e$.
	At first we need to show that the kernel of this map is equipped with divided powers.
	Since it is the $p$-adic completion of the kernel
	of the map $\mathbb{D}_{W[u]}(E(u)) \twoheadrightarrow R_e$,
	induced by $W[u] \twoheadrightarrow R_e$, we can study this and
	then apply \cref{PDExtendCompletion}.
	But this kernel is generated by $u^e$ hence it is equipped with divided powers,
	since $(E(u)) \triangleleft \mathcal{D}_{W[u]}(E(u))$ has a P.D. structure
	compatible with that of $(p)$ (and it is an Eisenstein polynomial).
	Then we can apply \cref{lem:A2Kisin} and obtain that the valuation
	$\mathbb{D}^*(G_e)(S)$ is in $\mathsf{C}_{S}$.
	Again as before we lift the isomorphism 
	\begin{equation*}
	\begin{tikzcd}
		M_e \arrow[r, "\sim", rightarrow] &
		\mathbb{D}^*(G_e)(R_e)
	\end{tikzcd}
	\end{equation*}
	in $\mathsf{C}_{R_e}$ to an isomorphism $M \simeq \mathbb{D}^*(G_e)(S)$
	compatible with $\varphi$.
	Now we need to lift the group $G_e$ to $O_K$ and we assume that $p > 2$.
	In order to do so we notice that, for all $i$,
	$O_K/p^{i-1}O_K \twoheadrightarrow O_K/ (p^i)$ and
	$S \twoheadrightarrow O_K/ (p^i)$ are equipped with
	divided powers, the first being nilpotent, the second existing by compatibility
	of divided powers on $u^e$ with those on $p$.
	Moreover, since $O_K$ is $p$-adically complete, thanks to \cite[Lemma 2.4.4]{deJong},
	we see that the datum of a Barsotti-Tate group on $O_K$ is equivalent to
	the data of a compatible sequence of Barsotti-Tate groups $G^i$ on $O_K/ (p^i)$.
	Here compatible means that the restriction of $G^i$ to $O_K/ (p^{i-1})$
	is isomorphic to $G^{i-1}$.
	Then, invoking again \cref{thm:EquivCatBTS}, we can construct this sequence by induction,
	taking at each time the group $G^i$ determined by $(\mathrm{Lie} G^i)^D \subset
	\mathbb{D}^*(G_e)(O_K/p^iO_K)$ given by the image of $\mathrm{Fil}^1 M$ under
	\begin{equation*}
	\begin{tikzcd}
		M \arrow[r, "\sim", rightarrow] &
		\mathbb{D}^*(G_e)(S) \arrow[r, "", rightarrow] &
		\mathbb{D}^*(G_e)(O_K/p^iO_K)
	.\end{tikzcd}
	\end{equation*}
	By functoriality of $\mathbb{D}^*(G_e)$ this gives rise to a compatible family $G^i$,
	which in turn, by \cite[Lemma 2.4.4]{deJong}, defines $G(M) \in \mathsf{BT}(O_K)$
	such that $(\mathrm{Lie}G)^D \subset \mathbb{D}^*(G_e)(O_K)$ is
	equal to the image of $\mathrm{Fil}^iM$ under
	\begin{equation*}
	\begin{tikzcd}
		M \arrow[r, "\sim", rightarrow] &
		\mathbb{D}^*(G_e)(S) \arrow[r, "", rightarrow] &
		\mathbb{D}^*(G_e)(O_K)
	.\end{tikzcd}
	\end{equation*}
\end{enumerate}
At last we are only left to prove that the above morphism are quasi inverse to each other.
It is clear, by construction, that $M \simeq M(G(M))$.
For the other direction we see, by induction on $i = 1, \ldots, e$, that uniqueness in
\cref{PDExtendCompletion} grants that, given any $G \in \mathsf{BT}(O_K)$, $G_i(M(G))$ is
isomorphic to the base change of $G$ to $O_K/ (\pi^i)$.
Analogously, for $i \in \mathbb{N}$, uniqueness in \cref{PDExtendCompletion} grants
that $G^i(M(G))$ is isomorphic to the base change of $G$ to $O_K/ (p^i)$.
Then, invoking again \cite[Lemma 2.4.4]{deJong}, we can conclude that $G(M(G)) \simeq G$
and the two functors are quasi-inverses to one another.
\end{proof}
